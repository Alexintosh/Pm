## DeFi.WTF Community Participation: 
 
### 1. "A DeFi Billboard" Harberger Taxes Social Experiment (Coming Soon)
 -  This is the only place you’ll see logos, REALLY LOUD LOGOS. We are creating “A DeFi Billboard” specifically to take shilling off the serious discussions.

 - “A DeFi Billboard” is both physical and virtual: We will conduct a continuous auction for 10 display slots on www.Defi.wtf  with a Harberger Tax mechanism. In a Harberger Taxation model, the buyer/advertiser sets the price, then the next buyer accepts the price, and pays a tax until he/she is bought out by another buyer, or he stops paying taxes. The tax goes to the event’s ENS address: defiwtf.eth. The proceeds will go into funding the event and funding research that comes out of the event.

 - Auction starts Oct 2, 2019

 - Participating in the continuous auction may result in: 
 - 1. Logo showing on a virtual DeFi Billboard on DeFi.WTF website.
 - 2. Logo showing on a physical retro-style neon billboard will also be presented at the event venue based on a snapshot taken of the on-chain auction (snapshot time to be announced).

 - "A DeFi Billboard" is inspired by previous experiments on Harberger Taxes:
   - ["This Artwork Is Always On Sale (TAIAOS)"](https://github.com/simondlr/thisartworkisalwaysonsale) by Simon de la Rouviere;
   - [Harberger Ads](https://devpost.com/software/harberger-ads) a 2018 ETHSanFrancisco winning hack;
   - [一块广告牌 An Advertisement Board](http://anadvertisementboard.com) by China's BES Studio;
   - [一块广告牌-橙皮书分叉版 An Advertisement Board- OrangePaper Edition](https://organge.xyz/orange-board/#/main) by Chinese media OrangePaper.

We need more help with design and implementation of the Harberger Taxes social experiment! (DM @CarboClanC on GitHub or Telegram @TinaZhen)

### 2. Donation to Community ENS: defiwtf.eth
 - If you love what we’re doing and want to help make it a success, consider donating!As an OG supporter, you’ll instantly enter the WTF events’ hall of fame.
- You can include a 140-word message about why you’re donating or anything you want to say to the DeFi community, and your name and comment will be displayed on community website (www.DeFi.WTF), Twitter (@WTFdao), and at the event.

### 3. Pop-up Collective - Dissolves after 21 Days
 - If you are a thinker/creative/hacker, join our pop-up collective of volunteers in preparation of that will exist for 21 days then dissolve. The collective will determine the spending of the donations and "A DeFi Billboard" proceeds, and publish the financials once the collective dissolves.
 - The collective will determine which research streams gets the remaining balance. Prior to dissolving, the collective also decides whether to turn into a loosely-organized community or a more institutionalized DAO with clear governing mechanism.
 - We need your brain power in helping us come up with the toughest questions that YOU care. Comment directly under this thread if you have a proposal or comments, and don't forget to VOTE when voting period begins. More details, coming soon!
  - We need more help with design and implementation of the Quadratic Voting tool, and the Harberger Taxes social experiment! (DM me @CarboClanC on GitHub or Telegram @TinaZhen)
